## Codewarz hosts it's first ever Live (open) Online Codewarz Event this Weekend

Starting on Saturday, 18 November at 1pm, it's game on at https://live.codewarz.ninja .  We'll have the scoreboard running all weekend until 9pm Monday.  So brush up on your coding and put some points on the leaderboard.  Welcome to all our new and returning competitors!  We hope you all have a great time.

## Ars Technica Weekend Event Coverage

We'd like to send a shoutout and a sincere thank you to Sean Gallagher at Ars Technica for the article on Friday.

## Language Support

We're currently supporting 13 languages, although our 14th language may be supported this weekend if we receive enough player requests.  If there's a language you'd like to see supported for the competition, send us an email via the Feedback link in the top navigation bar, or hit us up on slack.  If we can guage enough interest and have the spare cycles to implement this weekend, we will.  We are slowly increasing our language coverage as players make requests.
