## How many languages do you know?

This weekend, Codewarz is hosting a challenge to see who can solve the challenge in the most languages. So go ahead
and try out your BASH-foo and Scala wizardry.  The supported languages are listed in the [Player's Guide: Supported Language Reference](https://docs.codewarz.ninja/cwn_supported_languages.html).

### The Rules

1. You must have an account on https://codewarz.ninja. You are also encouraged to join our slack chat for support/questions.
2. We will issue a single programming challenge for this contest.
3. You must solve this challenge in as many programming languages as you can.
    * For languages that we support see https://docs.codewarz.ninja/cwn_supported_languages.html
    * Solve(s) must be submitted and scored correctly by our site in order for the submission to count.
    * Incorrect solves/entries do not count against you, only correct solves in varying languages count.
4. The players with the most correct solves for this challenge will enter a pool for winning prize(s).
    * Posting or sharing solutions will disqualify you from the contest
5. A rank-ordered list will be created from all entrants with the individual with the highest number of solves in different languages at the top of that list. We will use that rank-ordered list to offer individuals an opportunity to select a prize from the remaining prizes.
    * In the event of a tie, submission timestamps will be used to determine primacy.
    * Prize information can be found here
