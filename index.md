## Philosophy

Codewarz was created as a means to get individuals and organizations interested in learning to code. The best way to become a better programmer is by, well, programming. We created codewarz as a vehicle to challenge programmers at all experience levels in a fun and competitive fashion. Through gamification (and healthy competition), learning to code can be fun.
