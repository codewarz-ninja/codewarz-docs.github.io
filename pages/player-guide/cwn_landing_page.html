        This is the player's guide for the Codewarz persistent site. Here you'll find <b>most</b> of what you need to know to get started competing on the site, as well as working toward mastery of your language of choice.
        </p>
        <p>To your left you'll find links to the sections in this guide. If you have trouble finding anything, let us know through the feedback link at the top.

        <h2>Supported Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>It really doesn't matter what OS you use to write your code. It is important to keep in mind though what type of machine your code will be graded on.</p>
        <p>Although we try our best to filter carriage returns from your code using dos2unix, you may still have issues with your program's logic. Just keep in mind that a new line on Windows requires a carriage return <code>\r</code> character to move the
            cursor to the first column as well as a newline <code>\n</code> character to start a new line. Linux simply uses <code>\n</code> for new lines without the need for carriage returns.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h2>Submission Operating System Environments</h2>
        <p>For most submissions, we run your code in an isolated Linux container with no network connectivity whatsoever (except for the loopback address). The one exception is that we run C# submissions on a native Windows container with, likewise, no network
            connectivity except for the loopback address.</p>
