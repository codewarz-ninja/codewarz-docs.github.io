## How do I join?

Currently, joining Codewarz requires an invitation by a current member or admin.
However, registration may become open in the future.

If you would like to join and do not already know any current members, email us
via the Feedback link at the top.

## I've received an invitation to play Codewarz - what's next?

When you receive an invitation to create an account on the [website](https://codewarz.ninja)
via email, you should also receive an invitation to join our slack channel at [codewarzteam.slack.com](https://codewarzteam.slack.com). Slack chat is available
through any HTML5-compliant web browser, through mobile apps for iOS and Android,
and via Desktop Apps for Windows, Linux, and OSX. We strongly encourage you to
join us on Slack - there you'll get feedback on your submission results, help
from the admins, and you'll also be able to connect with your fellow players.

## Invite Your Friends

Each account comes with the ability to send invitations to join Codewarz. If you do not have any invitations, you can ask an admin in slack to provide you with some.
You can access this feature through your profile link at the top right of the
navigation panel on the persistent site.
