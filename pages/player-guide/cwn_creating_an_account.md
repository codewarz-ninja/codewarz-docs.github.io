## Creating an Account

Currently, joining Codewarz requires an invitation by a current member or admin.
However, registration may become open in the future.

If you would like to join and do not already know any current members, email us
via the Feedback link at the top.

When you receive an invitation to create an account on the [website](https://codewarz.ninja),
 you should also receive an invitation to join our slack channel at [codewarzteam.slack.com](https://codewarzteam.slack.com).
