        <h2>Language Support Issues</h2>
        <h3>Haskell Support</h3>
        <p>We have identified an unintended oversight with Haskell support that we plan to
            fix as soon as we get some spare cycles this weekend.  We apologize
            for the inconvenience.  You are welcome to submit with any of the other
            supported languages, or simply hang tight on your solve submissions
            until support is restored.  Thanks again for your understanding.</p>
        <h3>Language Requests</h3>
        <p>We try our best to support as many languages as we have an active
            community of player interest.  Currently C# and then Java have been
            commonly requested, and we will keep you posted as soon as we can
            make implementations on our infrastructure to support.  As always,
            if you would like to see a language supported that we don't offer,
            let an admin know.  Thanks.</p>
            
        <h2>Password Reset</h2>
        <p> We've had a few reports of issues with the password reset feature. For
            some individuals this has been a mistake of trying to log in to the
            persistent site at https://codewarz.ninja/ instead of the live competition
            site at https://live.codewarz.ninja/ .  Please ensure you are logging
            in to the right site for the account you are trying to access.  They
            are completely separate.</p>
        <p> During our next maintenance cycle we will take a look at the password
            reset feature to ensure it is functioning properly.</p>
        <p> In the mean time, send an email to an admin or dm us on slack.</p>
