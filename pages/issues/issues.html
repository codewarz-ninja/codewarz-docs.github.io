        <h2>Language Support Issues</h2>
        <h3>Haskell Support</h3>
        <p>As of 11:53PM EST on 18 November, we've implemented Haskell support during our maintenance window.</p>
        <h3>Language Requests</h3>
        <p>We try our best to support as many languages as we have an active
            community of player interest.  Currently C# and then Java have been
            commonly requested, and we will keep you posted as soon as we can
            make implementations on our infrastructure to support.  As always,
            if you would like to see a language supported that we don't offer,
            let an admin know.  Thanks.</p>
